\title{Calculating atmospheric pressure}
\usage{
cal_atmosphericPressure(elevation)
}
\arguments{
\item{elevation}{elevation above sea level (m)}
}
\value{
A vector for atmospheric pressure (Kpa)
}
\description{
The atmospheric pressure, P, is the pressure exerted by the
   weight of the earth's atmosphere.
}
\details{
Assuming 20Â°C for a standard atmosphere. Evaporation at high altitudes
   is promoted due to low atmospheric pressure as expressed in thepsychrometric
   constant. The effect is, however, small and in the calculation procedures,
   the average value for a location is sufficient.
